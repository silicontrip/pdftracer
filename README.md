## yet another java duplicates finder

Every man an his dog has written a duplicates finder and many existing tools (such as fdupes) do a fantastic job of finding duplicates.
But now that I have a list of duplicates how do I easily clean them up?  Do I randomly delete one of the files?

This program attempts to create a rules parser to delete duplicate files.
